## Trello Clone

This is a simple clone of the web app [Trello](http://www.trello.com), a project planning app. Users can create project boards; each board contains multiple lists representing phases of the project, and each list contains multiple cards representing individual tasks for the phase. Cards and lists can be dragged and rearranged with the mouse, and cards can be moved from one list to another.
